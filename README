    Don't worry about people stealing an idea;
    if it's original, you'll have to shove it down their throats. 
        - Howard Aiken

Paula and I have been working on this in stealth mode for some time. I'm the
ideas guy and she's the hacker. She's got some stuff going on in Boston and
I figure it's time to open this up to other players.

I don't know how well this will fly if we all jump aboard, but I'm hoping
that Howard is right and most folks won't even notice depsite the rather
public outing. Worst case scenario...

    a few of us finish this off

    we get famously rich

    others jump aboard

    they get rich

    someone makes this a double-clickable idiot-proof app

    the market is Seriously Messed Up by this activity

    things fall apart... but at least we're already rich, right?

So, please pitch in sooner rather than later and we'll all be fine.
